# Project Context

PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict, ES2024, ESM)
- **Package Manager**: Bun >= 1.2 (officially supported by Pulumi as package manager)
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint 9 (flat config), Prettier

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER use npm, yarn, or pnpm.** Always use `bun` for package management (`bun install`, `bun add`, `bun run`).
- **NEVER commit directly to the `main` branch.** Use Graphite `gt` for trunk-based development with PRs.
- **Pulumi runtime is Node.js** — Bun is the package manager only, not the runtime.

## Communication

- Chat with the user in Polish.
- All code, comments, commit messages, PR descriptions, and documentation must be in English.

## BMAD Framework

This project integrates the BMAD (Build Method for AI Development) framework in `_bmad/`.
Use BMAD commands (available in `.cursor/commands/bmad-*`) for product development workflows.
